## :muscle: Pull requests - Workflow

If you have code or documentation changes you would like to submit as a pull request, please 

* Fork the GitHub repository
* Make changes either directly in the forked devel branch or create a new branch for the changes you would like to submit for review
* Create a Pull Request (PR) and fill out the template, then submit the Pull Request for review

Your submitted changes will be reviewed. Additional changes may be suggested. Make sure that you monitor your notifications.
